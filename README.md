# Teamake
Teamake was one of the finalist projects in HackMTY. This apps helps you to organize team projects in school. You can add projects, add your team members that are near you, and then add jobs and assign it to each member. To mark a task as done you need to add a link where the file is saved (Dropbox, Drive, etc.). Later you can send all the project to he teacher with all the links that were saved.

This project was made by two iOS Hackers with Parse and Native Objective-C Code.
